            i was in my old house in colorado. i was with my family, but they weren't completely my family - they were different and seemed more like family friends or acquaintances. it was night time, and marcello was indoors, but i didn't see luca. i opened the door to our backyard and saw luca under a table outside, and i called for him to come in. there were two men outside the door, and they pushed their way in with knives in their hands and began stabbing everyone in the house. one of the house people came and stabbed them both at the end and was the only one who survived. 
            scene replays multiple times with the two men intruding and stabbing everyone. in the last iteration, the man in the house and i were the only ones in there from the beginning. when the two intruders came in, we stabbed them first violently with big, blunt bladed knives. it happened slowly, and i could hear and see their skin and flesh getting stabbed through. they were standing with giant gashes/holes and endless blood flowing out. they flinched but didn't seem fazed, and they were angry with us for stabbing them. they began approaching us angrily.
